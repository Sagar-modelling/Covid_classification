# Covid_classification
To Build a Deep Learning Model in Python that automatically detects the Patient having Covid-19 or not from chest X-ray images.
Approach:
We have to create a Dataset contains two folders, in which one has sampled X-Ray images of Normal Patients.
Then you have to create another folder in which you will put the X-Ray images of coronavirus patients.
After creating two folders we will merge the images and set the labels.
Then we will split that into training and testing set and create a VGG model that will predict our data.

Input X-ray Images !!
